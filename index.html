        <h2>functions in javascript</h2>

        <p>functions are important and valuables tools in programming. they are used to encapusluate and create reusable code. there are number of ways to create fuction in javascript, the most common way is by using the fuction keyword. after you have created a fucthins you must invoka or call it in order to run the code that it contains</p>

        <h2>scooping global and local</h2>
        <p>scooping is the concept of where your variables can be accessed. there are two major scopes: global and local. global cope variables are those that exit<strong>outside</strong> of loops, functions objects, etc. local scope variable are those that exit <strong>inside</strong> of loops, functions, objects , etc </p>

        <p id="scope1"></p>

        <p>global scope variables are typically declared in the main document and outside of any functions or object. they are, therefore, accessible by all functions in the documents. however, they run the risk of being overwitten, may create security loopholes and cuse some code efficiency problems.</p>

        <p id="scope2"></p>

        <p>local scope variables are declared inside of a function or object, etc. they are only accessiable by their parent element that they are declared inside of. these local variable run less risk of being overwitten becuse you must first reach into the function to access them. in the mordem, standers-compliant javascript, it is hoghly recommended to work mostly in local scope variables</p>

        <h1>passing argument</h1>

        <p>when a function is able to take in arguments, you can use those arguments to preform actions speific to the function. this is referred to as passing the argument to the function most of the time you pass arguments into a function in order for them to be used in some way. after use the result is typically returned so that elements outside of the function can use the return value</p>

        <p id="arguments"></p>

        <p>passing arguments is very common programming technique. it can be used for calulation as sample as adding two numbers, or as comple as equations.</p>

       <h2>conditionals and functions</h2>

       <p>functions can run more complex operations such as loops and conditionals.</p>
